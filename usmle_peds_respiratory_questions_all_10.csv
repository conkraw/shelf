1,"A 2-week-old male infant is brought to the emergency department with a 1-day history of poor feeding, irritability, and nasal congestion. The mother reports that he has been breathing rapidly and appears to be struggling to breathe. He was born at term with no complications. On exam, he is afebrile but has nasal flaring, intercostal retractions, and a respiratory rate of 68/min. Oxygen saturation is 91% on room air. Lung auscultation reveals diffuse wheezes and crackles. A rapid antigen test from a nasopharyngeal swab is positive.",Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Asthma,Bronchiolitis,Cystic fibrosis,Pertussis,Congenital pneumonia,b,"This infant presents with classic signs of bronchiolitis, most commonly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Bronchiolitis typically affects infants under 2 years of age and presents with cough, congestion, and signs of respiratory distress. Supportive care, including hydration and oxygen if needed, is the mainstay of treatment.",0.038,Respiratory
2,"A 6-week-old infant presents with a 3-day history of paroxysms of coughing, post-tussive vomiting, and difficulty feeding. Her parents report that she occasionally turns red and seems to stop breathing during the episodes. She has not yet received her first set of vaccinations. Vital signs show a respiratory rate of 60/min and oxygen saturation of 95%. On exam, the infant is alert but fatigued. No wheezing or crackles are noted. A lymphocytosis is present on complete blood count.",Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Pertussis,Bronchiolitis,Neonatal pneumonia,GERD,Asthma,a,"The clinical picture of paroxysmal coughing, post-tussive vomiting, and apnea in an unvaccinated young infant is characteristic of pertussis (whooping cough). Lymphocytosis is a classic lab finding. Infants are at high risk for complications, and macrolide antibiotics (e.g., azithromycin) are indicated.",0.115,Respiratory
3,"A 1-month-old boy presents to the clinic for noisy breathing since birth that worsens when lying on his back or during feeding. His parents describe a high-pitched inspiratory noise that improves when he is prone. He is feeding well and growing appropriately. On physical exam, he is in no distress, and the noise is reproducible when he becomes agitated.",Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Laryngomalacia,Tracheomalacia,Bronchiolitis,Choanal atresia,Vocal cord paralysis,a,Laryngomalacia is the most common cause of inspiratory stridor in infants. It results from collapse of the supraglottic structures during inspiration. Symptoms worsen when supine and improve when prone. Most cases resolve spontaneously by 18-24 months.,1.0,Respiratory
4,"A 2-month-old infant is brought to the ED with a 2-day history of cough, decreased feeding, and fever. The parents report labored breathing. Vital signs show a temperature of 38.5Â°C, respiratory rate of 72/min, and O2 saturation of 89%. Exam reveals intercostal retractions, nasal flaring, and diffuse crackles. A chest x-ray shows hyperinflation and peribronchial thickening.",Which of the following is the most appropriate management?,Start inhaled corticosteroids,Administer antibiotics,Provide supportive care including oxygen,Intubate and start mechanical ventilation,Begin oral bronchodilators,c,"This infant has bronchiolitis, most likely due to RSV. Treatment is supportive, including supplemental oxygen and hydration. Bronchodilators and corticosteroids are not routinely recommended unless there is a history suggestive of asthma.",2.0,Respiratory
5,"A 3-month-old infant presents with a persistent cough and wheezing. He has had multiple episodes of respiratory infections. Newborn screening was not performed. His stools are bulky and foul-smelling. On exam, he has nasal polyps and digital clubbing.",Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Bronchiolitis,Cystic fibrosis,Asthma,Primary ciliary dyskinesia,GERD,b,"Cystic fibrosis should be suspected in infants with recurrent respiratory infections, failure to thrive, and steatorrhea. Clubbing and nasal polyps are also common. Diagnosis is confirmed by sweat chloride testing or genetic testing.",3.0,Respiratory
6,"A 2-month-old infant is brought to the clinic due to episodes of apnea and cyanosis during feeding. The mother reports that the baby breathes noisily and often struggles during bottle feeds. On examination, the infant is alert and pink but has a continuous nasal discharge. Attempts to pass a nasogastric tube through the nostrils are unsuccessful. Oxygen saturation remains stable when crying but decreases while feeding.",Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Vocal cord paralysis,Laryngomalacia,Choanal atresia,Tracheoesophageal fistula,Bronchiolitis,c,Choanal atresia is a congenital condition in which the back of the nasal passage is blocked. Infants are obligate nasal breathers and may present with cyanosis during feeding that improves with crying. Failure to pass a nasogastric tube confirms the diagnosis. CT or endoscopy can be used for confirmation.,2,Respiratory
7,"A 5-week-old infant presents with persistent tachypnea and failure to thrive. The mother notes that the infant sweats excessively during feeding. On examination, there are crackles and a loud second heart sound. A chest x-ray shows increased pulmonary vascular markings and mild cardiomegaly.",Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Bronchiolitis,Pneumonia,Congenital heart disease,Pulmonary hypoplasia,Tracheomalacia,c,"Congenital heart disease with left-to-right shunt (e.g., VSD) often presents in infancy with signs of heart failure including tachypnea, poor feeding, and failure to thrive. Increased pulmonary markings and cardiomegaly are consistent with volume overload.",1.2,Respiratory
8,A 3-month-old infant presents with stridor and difficulty breathing that worsens when lying flat. The parents report the baby has had noisy breathing since birth. Flexible laryngoscopy reveals collapse of supraglottic structures during inspiration.,What is the most likely diagnosis?,Tracheomalacia,Laryngomalacia,Epiglottitis,Croup,Foreign body aspiration,b,Laryngomalacia is the most common cause of chronic stridor in infants and is due to collapse of the supraglottic structures. Symptoms worsen in the supine position and improve when prone. Diagnosis is confirmed with flexible laryngoscopy.,3,Respiratory
9,A 6-week-old male infant is brought to the emergency department due to cyanosis and poor feeding. He has had episodes of choking while feeding and persistent coughing. Physical exam reveals mild respiratory distress. A nasogastric tube coils in the upper esophagus on imaging.,What is the most likely diagnosis?,Esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula,Bronchiolitis,Gastroesophageal reflux,Cystic fibrosis,Choanal atresia,a,"Esophageal atresia with a distal tracheoesophageal fistula is a congenital anomaly often identified by coiling of an NG tube in the esophagus. Presentation includes feeding difficulties, choking, coughing, and respiratory distress. Prompt surgical correction is required.",1.5,Respiratory
