00A8AB4B,"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the pediatric clinic due to 6 months of intermittent abdominal pain, poor appetite, and weight concerns. The mother describes the pain as diffuse and crampy, lasting several hours, and often accompanied by vomiting. He has had intermittent diarrhea with bulky, foul-smelling, and greasy stools. Over this time, his appetite has declined and his clothing has become looser. On physical exam, the child appears thin, with a protuberant abdomen, and mild generalized abdominal tenderness without rebound or guarding. His growth chart reveals weight and height percentiles have dropped significantly compared to prior visits.","What is the most likely diagnosis?",Gastroenteritis,"Celiac disease","Irritable bowel syndrome",Appendicitis,"Inflammatory bowel disease",b,"This child's constellation of symptoms-including chronic abdominal pain, vomiting, foul-smelling diarrhea (steatorrhea), failure to thrive, abdominal distention, and poor weight gain-is highly suggestive of celiac disease, an autoimmune enteropathy triggered by gluten ingestion in genetically predisposed individuals. In children, celiac disease often presents with chronic gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Signs of malabsorption are common, including greasy, foul-smelling stools and growth failure. Affected children may also exhibit weight loss or a failure to gain weight despite an adequate or even increased appetite. Irritability or fatigue can also be part of the clinical picture. Diagnosis is typically confirmed by positive anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA antibodies and small bowel biopsy showing villous atrophy.    The other answer choices are less likely given the clinical presentation. Gastroenteritis typically presents with an acute onset of vomiting and diarrhea that resolves within a few days. It does not cause prolonged symptoms or chronic growth failure. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is rare in toddlers and is more commonly diagnosed in adolescents and adults; it does not cause weight loss, vomiting, or steatorrhea, and growth parameters are typically normal. Appendicitis usually presents with acute, localized abdominal pain, most often in the right lower quadrant, and may be accompanied by fever and nausea, but it does not cause chronic symptoms or growth failure. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may present with similar symptoms and growth delay, but it generally affects older children or adolescents and is often associated with bloody diarrhea, perianal disease, or systemic signs such as fever, none of which are present in this case.","3 years",7,,2
0D686278,"A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents. They report that he has had a fever for the past 3 days, which has been as high as 102°F at home. He has also been complaining of pain in his right leg, and they have noticed that he has been limping. On examination, the boy appears ill and has a temperature of 101.5°F. His right hip is tender to palpation and he resists passive movement of the hip joint. Laboratory studies show a white blood cell count of 14,000/mm3 and a C-reactive protein level of 4.5 mg/dL.","What is the most appropriate treatment?","Intravenous antibiotics and surgical drainage","Oral antibiotics and rest","Intravenous fluids and antipyretics","Surgical intervention and physical therapy","Pain management and observation",a,"This 4-year-old boy presents with fever, a limp, and refusal to bear weight or move his right hip, along with an elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein-classic features of septic arthritis, which is a pediatric orthopedic emergency. Septic arthritis most frequently affects the hip in young children and requires urgent intervention to prevent irreversible joint damage and systemic complications.    The most appropriate treatment is intravenous (IV) antibiotics and surgical drainage. IV antibiotics, typically aimed at Staphylococcus aureus-the most common causative organism-should be started immediately. However, surgical drainage is essential to remove purulent material, relieve intra-articular pressure, and control the inflammatory process. Delays in treatment can result in avascular necrosis, growth plate injury, or chronic arthritis.    Other treatment options are not appropriate for this condition. Oral antibiotics and rest are insufficient for septic arthritis, which requires parenteral therapy and often surgical intervention. Oral antibiotics may be used after improvement with IV therapy but are not adequate as initial treatment in a joint-threatening infection. IV fluids and antipyretics may help with hydration and symptom relief but do not treat the underlying infection, and delaying definitive treatment can lead to worsening disease. Surgical intervention combined with physical therapy may seem partially correct, but physical therapy should not be initiated during the acute infection phase, as it may exacerbate inflammation or cause further harm; it's only appropriate after the infection has resolved. Finally, pain management and observation dangerously underestimates the severity of septic arthritis. While symptom control is important, failure to address the infection can result in joint destruction, sepsis, or death.","4 years",19,,2
0MCQWLGE,"A 15-month-old girl is brought to the pediatric clinic by her parents due to concerns about bowed legs and delayed walking. She was born full-term without complications and has otherwise been healthy. Her parents note that she has not yet started walking independently, and they have noticed that her legs appear curved. She drinks approximately 30 ounces of cow's milk per day but does not consume fortified formula or vitamin supplements. The family lives in a northern climate, and the child spends most of her time indoors with minimal sun exposure.    On physical examination, the child has frontal bossing, widened wrists, and a prominent costochondral junction (rachitic rosary). Radiographs of the lower extremities reveal metaphyseal cupping and fraying at the distal femur and proximal tibia.","What is the most likely diagnosis?","Lead poisoning","Iron deficiency anemia","Calcipenic rickets","Phosphenic rickets","Osteogenesis imperfecta",c,"This child presents with classic features of calcipenic rickets, a condition most commonly caused by vitamin D deficiency, which leads to inadequate calcium absorption from the gut and impaired bone mineralization. Characteristic clinical signs include bowed legs (genu varum) due to weight-bearing on soft, demineralized bones; frontal bossing and widened wrists resulting from abnormal growth plate activity; and a rachitic rosary, which describes the beaded appearance at the costochondral junctions. Radiographic findings typically reveal cupping and fraying of the metaphyses, which are hallmark features of rickets. This child's risk factors-such as a diet high in cow's milk (which is low in vitamin D and may be low in phosphate), lack of sunlight exposure, and no vitamin D supplementation-are all common contributors to vitamin D deficiency in toddlers.    The other answer choices are less likely based on the presentation. Lead poisoning can result in developmental delays and anemia, but it does not cause bony deformities like bowed legs or metaphyseal changes, and it lacks features like wrist widening or a rachitic rosary. Iron deficiency anemia, while common in toddlers who consume excessive cow's milk, typically presents with pallor, fatigue, and sometimes pica, but does not cause skeletal abnormalities or the radiographic findings seen in this case. Phosphopenic rickets (such as X-linked hypophosphatemia) can also cause bowing of the legs and bony deformities, but affected children usually have normal vitamin D levels, adequate sun exposure, and a family history, since it is often inherited. This child's presentation and clear risk factors for vitamin D deficiency make calcipenic rickets the more likely diagnosis. Osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic condition, is characterized by brittle bones and frequent fractures, rather than bowed legs or rachitic changes. It is also associated with blue sclerae, hearing loss, and dentinogenesis imperfecta-none of which are present in this child.","15 months",16,0MCQWLGE.jpg,2
0ZFYGDKY,"A 13-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his parents due to concerns about delayed physical development. They note that he appears smaller and less physically mature than his classmates. He has not experienced voice deepening or growth of body hair. The patient denies fatigue, headaches, visual disturbances, or other systemic symptoms. He is otherwise healthy, performs well in school, and is active in sports. Family history reveals that his father experienced delayed puberty, with noticeable changes beginning around age 15. On physical exam, the patient has no axillary or pubic hair (Tanner stage I), and testicular volume is less than 4 mL bilaterally. His height is at the 10th percentile for age, and growth velocity has been normal. Bone age radiograph shows findings consistent with a skeletal age of approximately 10 years.","What is the most appropriate management?","Order brain MRI","Start testosterone therapy","Reassure and monitor pubertal progression","Refer to endocrinology","Check serum prolactin and TSH",c,"This boy's presentation is most consistent with constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP), a common and benign variant of normal development. CDGP is typically characterized by short stature for age with a normal growth velocity, delayed onset of pubertal signs (such as Tanner stage I beyond age 13 in boys), and a bone age that lags behind chronological age. A family history of delayed puberty is also frequently present, as seen here in the father. While CDGP is a diagnosis of exclusion, a classic history without red flags-such as neurologic symptoms, signs of systemic disease, or evidence of growth failure-makes it reasonable to proceed with reassurance and regular monitoring. Most boys with CDGP will experience spontaneous onset of puberty, just later than average.    Other answer choices are less appropriate in this scenario. Ordering a brain MRI (Choice A) is typically reserved for cases where there are concerning neurologic symptoms like vision changes, headaches, or signs of hypopituitarism, none of which are present in this well-appearing adolescent with a positive family history. Starting testosterone therapy (Choice B) can be considered in CDGP if significant psychosocial distress is present, but it is not first-line when the patient is otherwise emotionally well and physically healthy. Referral to endocrinology (Choice D) is appropriate when there is diagnostic uncertainty, abnormal lab results, or poor growth velocity; however, it is not necessary when the presentation is classic and reassuring. Lastly, checking serum prolactin and TSH (Choice E) is helpful if central hypothyroidism or hyperprolactinemia is suspected-typically in cases of growth failure or systemic symptoms, which are not features of this patient's clinical picture.","13 years",1,,2
00ZG699S,"A 12-year-old girl is brought to the pediatric clinic by her parents because of noticeable breast asymmetry. They report that her right breast has been developing over the past few months, while the left side appears unchanged. She has not yet had menarche. She denies breast pain, nipple discharge, or recent trauma. There is no family history of breast disease, and she has been otherwise healthy and growing well. On physical examination, the right breast is Tanner stage III and the left is Tanner stage I. No masses, skin dimpling, or lymphadenopathy are noted.","What is the most appropriate next step?","Order breast ultrasound","Reassure and monitor development","Perform breast biopsy","Refer to pediatric surgery","Obtain estrogen and prolactin levels",b,"Asymmetric breast development is a common and normal finding during puberty, especially in early to mid-pubertal girls. It is not unusual for breast tissue to develop at different rates on each side, and one breast may appear noticeably larger than the other for several months to even a year. In this case, the patient is otherwise healthy, with no red-flag features such as a palpable mass, skin changes, rapid enlargement, pain, or nipple discharge. She is at an expected stage of pubertal development for her age, and her asymmetry appears to be part of a typical growth pattern.    The most appropriate next step is reassurance and routine monitoring. In most cases, breast asymmetry resolves on its own as both breasts eventually progress through the stages of development and reach symmetry.    The other answer choices are not appropriate for this situation. Ordering a breast ultrasound is unnecessary in a healthy pubertal girl without concerning findings. Imaging should be reserved for cases with a palpable or suspicious mass, persistent asymmetry beyond puberty, or other signs suggesting pathology. Breast biopsy is an invasive procedure and is not indicated in physiologic asymmetry without a discrete lesion. Performing a biopsy without clinical justification risks unnecessary complications and anxiety. Referral to pediatric surgery is also not appropriate at this stage. Surgical consultation may be considered only in late adolescence or adulthood if asymmetry persists and causes significant psychosocial distress. Lastly, obtaining estrogen and prolactin levels is unwarranted in the absence of signs of endocrine dysfunction, such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, or global delay in pubertal development. This girl is clearly entering puberty normally, just with asynchronous breast growth, which is entirely expected.","12 years",1,,2
7CQU6IC4,"At a routine 9-month well-child visit, parents report that their daughter has recently become more wary around unfamiliar people. In new environments, she tends to cling to them and shows signs of distress when approached by strangers. The child is meeting motor milestones: she can crawl, pull to stand, and bang two blocks together. She vocalizes with sounds like ""mama"" and ""dada,"" but not specifically. The parents are concerned about her recent behavior changes.","Which developmental milestone is most consistent with this child's age?","Pincer grasp","Climbing stairs","Stranger anxiety","Walking without assistance","Speaking two-word phrases",c,"Stranger anxiety is a normal developmental milestone that typically emerges between 6 and 9 months of age, becoming especially pronounced around 9 months. As infants begin to develop object permanence and form stronger attachments to their primary caregivers, they naturally become more wary of unfamiliar people. This anxiety or distress in response to strangers is a healthy and expected part of social and cognitive development, and it should be viewed as a reassuring sign-not a behavioral issue.    The other answer choices are less consistent with the developmental stage of a 9-month-old. Pincer grasp-the fine motor skill of using the thumb and forefinger to pick up small objects-usually develops around 9 to 10 months, but it is not as consistently present at exactly 9 months as stranger anxiety. Climbing stairs typically emerges much later, around 18 months, once the child has more developed balance and coordination; a 9-month-old is not expected to be able to perform this gross motor task. Walking without assistance generally occurs between 12 and 15 months. At 9 months, it is more typical for infants to pull to stand and perhaps begin cruising, but they do not yet walk independently. Finally, speaking two-word phrases is a language milestone expected closer to 24 months. While 9-month-olds may babble and say sounds like ""mama"" or ""dada,"" they are not yet combining words meaningfully.","9 months",4,,2
540WLT6F,"A 6-month-old infant is brought in for a routine well-child visit. The parents report that their baby can sit with support, reach for and grasp toys, and laugh aloud during play. She also babbles and turns her head toward voices. Her growth and weight are tracking appropriately along the growth curve, and she is feeding well.","Which milestone is expected at this age?","Walks independently","Transfers objects between hands","Stands with assistance","Speaks first word","Feeds self with spoon",b,"At 6 months of age, infants achieve several important motor and language milestones. One key fine motor milestone is the ability to transfer objects from one hand to the other, which demonstrates developing hand-eye coordination and bilateral motor control. Other expected milestones at this age include gross motor skills such as sitting with support and rolling over from front to back and back to front. In terms of fine motor development, infants can reach for and grasp objects. Language milestones include laughing aloud, babbling, and turning toward sounds or voices, indicating growing auditory awareness and social responsiveness. Socially, 6-month-olds typically enjoy interacting with others and may begin to show early signs of stranger recognition.    The other answer choices are not developmentally appropriate for a 6-month-old. Walking independently (Choice A) usually occurs between 12 and 15 months, well after the current age. Standing with assistance (Choice C) is more commonly seen around 9 to 10 months, as it requires better strength and balance than most 6-month-olds possess. Speaking the first word (Choice D) generally happens around 12 months, whereas 6-month-olds typically engage in babbling without meaningful word use. Finally, feeding oneself with a spoon (Choice E) is a more advanced self-help skill that typically emerges between 15 and 18 months, once fine motor coordination has matured further.","6 months",4,,2
20250407105520,"A 2-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department after being found unresponsive during a nap. Despite resuscitation efforts, he is pronounced dead. The parents are devastated and ask if anything could have prevented this. The infant was born full-term without complications and had been feeding well. According to the parents, the baby usually slept in their bed between them. They mention that he often falls asleep while breastfeeding and remains there throughout the night. At the time of death, he was swaddled in a loose blanket and lying on his stomach on an adult mattress. There is no family history of cardiac or genetic disorders.","Which of the following is the most important modifiable risk factor in this case?","Bed-sharing with parents","Full-term gestation","Male sex","Lack of family history","Exclusive breastfeeding",a,"This vignette describes a case of Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID), most likely due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Among the details provided, the most significant modifiable risk factor is bed-sharing. Bed-sharing-especially in infants under 4 months-markedly increases the risk of accidental suffocation and SIDS due to the dangers of soft mattresses, loose bedding, and the potential for parental overlay. Adult beds are not designed to meet the safety standards necessary for infant sleep, and current guidelines strongly advise that infants sleep in the same room but on a separate, firm sleep surface.    The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:  Full-term gestation (Choice B) is not a risk factor for SIDS; in contrast, preterm birth is associated with a higher risk. Male sex (Choice C) is statistically associated with a slightly higher incidence of SIDS, but it is a non-modifiable factor. Lack of family history (Choice D) is irrelevant in this context, as most cases of SIDS occur in infants with no family history of sudden death-so its absence does not reduce risk, nor is it a modifiable factor. Exclusive breastfeeding (Choice E) is actually protective against SIDS, likely due to its beneficial effects on arousal mechanisms and immune protection.","2 months",15,,2
20250407105609,"A 17-year-old previously healthy girl is evaluated after a transient loss of consciousness at school. She had been sitting in class when she suddenly felt lightheaded and nauseated, then slumped to the floor. Witnesses report that she lost consciousness for less than a minute and did not exhibit abnormal movements. Her eyes were closed, and she was pale but breathing normally. She regained consciousness quickly without confusion and was fully oriented. She reported feeling tired afterward but otherwise well, aside from a mild headache from hitting her head.    Her vitals at the time of the episode were BP 128/76 mm Hg and pulse 78/min.    ECG is normal.    Physical exam is unremarkable.","Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Cataplexy,"Conversion disorder","Generalized seizure","Vasovagal syncope","Cardiac arrhythmia",d,"This adolescent presents with a classic case of vasovagal syncope, the most common cause of transient loss of consciousness in teenagers. Key features of vasovagal syncope include a prodrome of lightheadedness, nausea, warmth, or visual changes, followed by a brief loss of consciousness without any seizure-like activity, and a quick return to baseline mental status without postictal confusion. The physical exam and ECG are normal, which further supports a benign etiology. There is no evidence of a cardiac cause, as there are no reported palpitations, murmurs, or ECG abnormalities. Additionally, the absence of features such as tonic-clonic movements, prolonged unresponsiveness, postictal confusion, or incontinence argues against a seizure disorder.    The other diagnoses are less likely. Cataplexy is a sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by emotions (such as laughter) and occurs in the context of narcolepsy, which is not suggested here. Conversion disorder would involve inconsistent neurological findings or unexplained neurologic symptoms that don't follow known patterns of disease; this patient's symptoms are physiologic and well explained. Generalized seizures typically include tonic-clonic activity, a longer period of unconsciousness, and postictal confusion, none of which are present. Finally, cardiac arrhythmia often causes sudden syncope without warning, which contrasts with this patient's clear prodromal symptoms and normal ECG, making it an unlikely cause.","17 years",2,,2
KSTS6JVC,"<p>A newborn female infant is evaluated shortly after delivery due to concerns about dysmorphic features and intrauterine growth restriction. The infant was born at 39 weeks gestation to a 23-year-old woman with no prenatal care. The mother arrived in active labor and had a spontaneous vaginal delivery. Apgar scores were 7 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Birth weight is 2.4 kg (5.3 lb). Physical examination reveals microcephaly, small eyes with short palpebral fissures, a smooth philtrum, and thin upper lip. She also has a heart murmur.</p>","Further evaluation of the mother would most likely reveal a history of which of the following? ","Amphetamine use during pregnancy","Cigarette smoking during pregnancy","Chronic hypertension","Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus","Regular alcohol consumption during pregnancy",e,"This infant exhibits features that are characteristic of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), including microcephaly, a smooth philtrum, thin upper lip, and short palpebral fissures. Additional findings often include growth restriction and congenital heart defects, particularly septal defects. FAS results from maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, a critical period for organogenesis and brain development. Alcohol is a known teratogen that disrupts neuronal migration and differentiation, leading to both structural and functional abnormalities in the developing fetus.    The other choices are less consistent with this presentation. Amphetamine use (Choice A) can lead to fetal growth restriction and preterm delivery, but it does not cause the distinctive facial features seen in FAS. Cigarette smoking (Choice B) increases the risk of low birth weight and preterm birth, yet it also lacks the craniofacial dysmorphism associated with FAS. Chronic hypertension (Choice C) can lead to uteroplacental insufficiency and intrauterine growth restriction, but it is not associated with facial abnormalities. Lastly, poorly controlled maternal diabetes (Choice D) is more commonly linked to macrosomia and congenital anomalies such as neural tube defects or cardiac malformations, but it does not typically result in microcephaly or facial dysmorphism like those seen in FAS.",0,14,,2
XLDE0WRG,"<p>A full-term male newborn is evaluated for cyanosis shortly after birth. He was born at 38 weeks gestation via uncomplicated vaginal delivery to a healthy 26-year-old woman. There were no prenatal concerns, and Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes. Birth weight is 3.3 kg (7 lb 4 oz). On physical examination, the infant appears cyanotic but is otherwise active and well perfused. Breath sounds are clear bilaterally. No murmurs are appreciated on cardiac auscultation. Oxygen saturation is 78% on room air and remains unchanged after administration of 100% oxygen.</p>","Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","Truncus arteriosus","Tetralogy of Fallot","Transposition of the great arteries","Meconium aspiration syndrome","Pulmonary atresia",c,"This neonate presents with central cyanosis without respiratory distress and a lack of improvement in oxygenation despite 100% oxygen, a clinical scenario that strongly suggests cyanotic congenital heart disease. Among the various causes, transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is the most common cyanotic heart defect in the first 24 hours of life. In TGA, the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle, creating two parallel circulations that prevent effective oxygenation of systemic blood. Survival depends on the presence of a mixing lesion, such as a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), atrial septal defect (ASD), or ventricular septal defect (VSD), which allows some oxygenated blood to reach the systemic circulation.    Other diagnoses are less likely in this scenario. Truncus arteriosus and Tetralogy of Fallot often present later in infancy or with an audible murmur. Meconium aspiration syndrome causes cyanosis as well but is typically associated with respiratory distress and abnormal findings on lung examination. Pulmonary atresia may mimic TGA in presentation but frequently includes a murmur and tends to cause more severe cyanosis from birth. The absence of a murmur and the early onset of cyanosis in this case make TGA the most likely diagnosis.",0,15,,2
