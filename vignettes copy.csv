1,"A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents due to a 2-day history of high-grade fever, progressive sore throat, and difficulty swallowing. His parents also report that he has been drooling excessively and refuses to lie down, instead preferring to sit upright and lean forward with his neck extended. They noticed a muffled quality to his voice and that he becomes more agitated when attempting to open his mouth. On physical examination, the child appears toxic and anxious. His temperature is 39.5°C (103.1°F), respiratory rate is 36/min, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. There is marked drooling, inspiratory stridor, and no obvious oropharyngeal lesions visualized due to difficulty opening his mouth.",Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?,Administer oral amoxicillin and observe,Order a throat culture,Perform direct laryngoscopy in the office,Secure the airway in the operating room,Send the patient home with supportive care,d,"The presentation is classic for acute epiglottitis, which is a life-threatening condition most commonly caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) in unvaccinated children. Children typically present with sudden onset fever, dysphagia, drooling, muffled 'hot potato' voice, and a preference to sit in the tripod position to maximize airway patency. Examination may show inspiratory stridor and signs of respiratory distress. Attempts to visualize the oropharynx or perform procedures without proper airway protection can precipitate complete airway obstruction. The most appropriate next step is to secure the airway in a controlled environment such as the operating room with skilled personnel available (ENT and anesthesiology). Once the airway is secured, intravenous antibiotics are initiated.",4,Emergency Medicine
2,"A 2-week-old newborn boy is brought to the emergency department with a 1-day history of poor feeding, lethargy, and several episodes of vomiting. The baby was born at term without complications and was discharged home on day 2 of life. Since discharge, the parents report the baby has been feeding less and sleeping more. Today, he became more irritable and difficult to arouse. He has not had a wet diaper in over 12 hours. Vital signs reveal a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 178/min, and blood pressure of 70/40 mmHg. On examination, he is hypotonic with poor suck reflex. Laboratory studies reveal serum sodium of 126 mEq/L, potassium of 6.8 mEq/L, glucose of 42 mg/dL, and metabolic acidosis.",Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,Galactosemia,Neonatal sepsis,Phenylketonuria,Hypothyroidism,a,"This neonate presents with hypotonia, lethargy, vomiting, and electrolyte abnormalities including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia—findings that are highly suggestive of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), specifically 21-hydroxylase deficiency. This condition leads to impaired cortisol and aldosterone synthesis, resulting in salt-wasting and a compensatory increase in ACTH, causing adrenal hyperplasia and overproduction of androgens. Affected male infants may not be diagnosed at birth due to normal external genitalia but can rapidly decompensate due to adrenal crisis, as seen in this case. Prompt recognition and treatment with IV fluids, hydrocortisone, and correction of electrolyte imbalances are critical to prevent mortality.",0.038,Endocrinology
