1,"A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents due to a 2-day history of high-grade fever, progressive sore throat, and difficulty swallowing. His parents also report that he has been drooling excessively and refuses to lie down, instead preferring to sit upright and lean forward with his neck extended. They noticed a muffled quality to his voice and that he becomes more agitated when attempting to open his mouth. On physical examination, the child appears toxic and anxious. His temperature is 39.5°C (103.1°F), respiratory rate is 36/min, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. There is marked drooling, inspiratory stridor, and no obvious oropharyngeal lesions visualized due to difficulty opening his mouth.",Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?,Administer oral amoxicillin and observe,Order a throat culture,Perform direct laryngoscopy in the office,Secure the airway in the operating room,Send the patient home with supportive care,d,"The presentation is classic for acute epiglottitis, which is a life-threatening condition most commonly caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) in unvaccinated children. Children typically present with sudden onset fever, dysphagia, drooling, muffled 'hot potato' voice, and a preference to sit in the tripod position to maximize airway patency. Examination may show inspiratory stridor and signs of respiratory distress. Attempts to visualize the oropharynx or perform procedures without proper airway protection can precipitate complete airway obstruction. The most appropriate next step is to secure the airway in a controlled environment such as the operating room with skilled personnel available (ENT and anesthesiology). Once the airway is secured, intravenous antibiotics are initiated.",4,Emergency Medicine
2,"A 2-week-old newborn boy is brought to the emergency department with a 1-day history of poor feeding, lethargy, and several episodes of vomiting. The baby was born at term without complications and was discharged home on day 2 of life. Since discharge, the parents report the baby has been feeding less and sleeping more. Today, he became more irritable and difficult to arouse. He has not had a wet diaper in over 12 hours. Vital signs reveal a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 178/min, and blood pressure of 70/40 mmHg. On examination, he is hypotonic with poor suck reflex. Laboratory studies reveal serum sodium of 126 mEq/L, potassium of 6.8 mEq/L, glucose of 42 mg/dL, and metabolic acidosis.",Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,Galactosemia,Neonatal sepsis,Phenylketonuria,Hypothyroidism,a,"This neonate presents with hypotonia, lethargy, vomiting, and electrolyte abnormalities including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia—findings that are highly suggestive of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), specifically 21-hydroxylase deficiency. This condition leads to impaired cortisol and aldosterone synthesis, resulting in salt-wasting and a compensatory increase in ACTH, causing adrenal hyperplasia and overproduction of androgens. Affected male infants may not be diagnosed at birth due to normal external genitalia but can rapidly decompensate due to adrenal crisis, as seen in this case. Prompt recognition and treatment with IV fluids, hydrocortisone, and correction of electrolyte imbalances are critical to prevent mortality.",0.038,Endocrinology
3,"A 6-year-old boy is brought to the pediatric clinic with complaints of swelling around his eyes that is most noticeable in the morning and resolves partially throughout the day. His parents also report that his urine has become increasingly frothy over the past few days. He has no recent history of fever, sore throat, or skin infections. He has been eating and playing normally. On examination, he has periorbital and pedal edema, and his abdomen is distended with shifting dullness suggestive of ascites. Vital signs are normal, and there is no evidence of rash or joint swelling. Urinalysis shows 4+ proteinuria with no red blood cells or casts. Serum albumin is 1.8 g/dL, and cholesterol is elevated.",Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Acute glomerulonephritis,IgA nephropathy,Minimal change disease,Membranous nephropathy,Diabetic nephropathy,c,"This child presents with periorbital edema, ascites, frothy urine, and significant proteinuria without hematuria—hallmarks of nephrotic syndrome. Minimal change disease is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children and typically occurs in children under 10 years of age. The condition is characterized by effacement of podocyte foot processes on electron microscopy, with no changes seen on light microscopy. Although the exact cause is unknown, it is thought to involve T-cell mediated injury to the glomerular filtration barrier. The disease responds dramatically to corticosteroids in the majority of cases, and renal biopsy is usually not necessary unless there is no response to initial therapy.",6,Nephrology
4,"A 3-year-old girl is brought to the clinic by her parents for evaluation of a new rash. Three days ago, she developed a high fever up to 40°C (104°F), which resolved spontaneously yesterday. This morning, her parents noticed a pink, non-pruritic rash that began on her trunk and has now spread to her neck and proximal extremities. The child is otherwise well-appearing, playful, and interactive. Physical examination reveals a blanching, maculopapular rash on the chest and back. There is no conjunctivitis, oral lesions, or lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable.",Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Measles,Rubella,Roseola infantum,Erythema infectiosum,Scarlet fever,c,"This child’s clinical presentation is most consistent with roseola infantum, also known as exanthem subitum, caused by human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6). It typically affects children between 6 months and 3 years of age and is characterized by a sudden high fever lasting 3–5 days followed by the abrupt appearance of a blanching, pink maculopapular rash that starts on the trunk and spreads to the neck and extremities as the fever resolves. The child appears well during the rash phase, distinguishing it from other febrile rash illnesses like measles or rubella, where the child is usually more ill-appearing. Supportive care is the treatment of choice as the illness is self-limited.",3,Infectious Disease
5,"A 15-year-old girl presents to the adolescent medicine clinic with concerns about not having started her periods. She reports normal breast development beginning at age 12 but has never had any vaginal bleeding. She denies any cyclical abdominal pain. On review of systems, she notes that she does not have underarm or pubic hair. She is otherwise healthy and active in sports. Her height and weight are at the 50th percentile for age. Physical examination shows Tanner stage IV breast development but no pubic or axillary hair. External genitalia appear female, but the vaginal canal ends in a blind pouch. No uterus or ovaries are palpable on bimanual exam. Pelvic ultrasound confirms absence of a uterus. Karyotype analysis is pending.",Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Turner syndrome,Androgen insensitivity syndrome,Müllerian agenesis,Constitutional growth delay,Hypothalamic amenorrhea,b,"This adolescent female presents with primary amenorrhea, normal breast development, absent pubic and axillary hair, and a blind-ending vagina with no palpable uterus—findings that are strongly indicative of complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). AIS is caused by mutations in the androgen receptor in individuals with a 46,XY karyotype. Despite normal testosterone production by the testes, the tissues are unresponsive to androgens, resulting in a phenotypically female appearance. The testes are usually located intra-abdominally or in the inguinal canals, and there is a high risk of gonadal malignancy if not removed after puberty. Breast development occurs due to peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens, while the absence of pubic/axillary hair is due to androgen resistance. Pelvic ultrasound and karyotyping help confirm the diagnosis.",15,Reproductive Endocrinology
